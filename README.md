# The **Minesweeper**

[You can read the Wikipedia article about this game here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game))

Instructions:

You click on a cell to open it. If it is a mined cell, the game ends in a loss. 

Otherwise, the opened cell displays:
- either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and adjacent to it, 
- or a blank tile (or "0"), and all adjacent non-mined cells will automatically be opened. 

You can also flag a cell (with right-click on desktop computer or long-tap on mobile), to mark that you believe a mine to be in that cell.
While flagged, you cannot open the cell by a click/tap.
Flagged cells may be unflagged.

In order to win the game, you should:
- open all cells except the mined ones;
- or flag all the mined cells;

When the game is won, you will see a message with number of moves and the time you spent to win the game.
